Project: Analyzing Historical Apple Stock Prices
Objective:

This project aims to analyze the historical stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2010 to 2022 using the Yahoo Finance API. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the stock's behavior, calculate daily returns, and visualize the correlations between different metrics.

Project Description:

Data Acquisition:

We will use the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve historical stock price data for AAPL from 2010 to 2022.
The data will be downloaded in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

The downloaded data will be converted into a Pandas DataFrame for efficient data manipulation.
The 'Date' column will be set as the index to facilitate time-series analysis.
We will check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics will be calculated to get an overview of the stock price distribution.
Data types will be verified to ensure consistency.
Missing values will be identified and addressed.
A line chart will be plotted to visualize the stock price over time.
Calculating Daily Returns:

Daily returns will be calculated as the percentage change in stock price from one day to the next.
A line chart will be plotted to visualize the daily returns over time.
Analyzing Daily Returns Distribution:

A histogram will be plotted to understand the distribution of daily returns.
This will help identify patterns and potential risks.
Correlation Analysis:

A correlation matrix will be calculated to measure the relationships between different metrics (e.g., stock price, daily returns).
A heatmap will be plotted to visualize the correlation matrix.
